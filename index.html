          <p>
            Hello! My name is Sara Austin and I live in Raleigh, NC. I am currently in the University of North
            Carolina's Coding Boot Camp studying to be a full stack web developer. I am also taking the necessary
            prerequisite courses to apply to graduate school for Computer Science. I also have a B.A. from The
            University of Alabama.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time in coding boot camp, I have learned a variety of skills. I have learned to work in a
            collaborative environment with a focus on pair programming. I have learned the following programming skills:
            HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, Javascript, Ajax, Firebase, and Node.js. I have worked on a variety of
            projects and will continue to do so throughout my time in the program.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have worn many hats throughout my career. As a result, I am able to navigate through complex challenges
            with good judgement, communicate strongly with others, listen well to others, meet deadlines, and
            collaborate well with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge
            set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques. I believe that my passion for web
            development, commitment to my continuing education in computer science, and strong skills in HTML5, CSS3 and
            JavaScript make me the ideal candidate for a position as Front End Developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to having the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can be an asset to your team.
          </p>
